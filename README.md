Hello there! My name is Rafael and I am currently studying computer science in Paris.
In my profile you will mainly see Web projects both statics and dynamics.

I learn languages such as PHP, Javascript, C, and I also learned how to use Oracle, Mysql and I'm confortable with Linux (Debian, Ubuntu and a bit of fedora)

I really like cybersecurity, so you may see some security-related projects later on. 

For now I invite you to check my projects made with 2 of my friends in school (One of them will be finished by the end of may).

Hope you will enjoy my projects! Have a nice day !
